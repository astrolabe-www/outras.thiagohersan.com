Algotypes are interventions in the 2.4GHz WiFi band.

Despite pop-culture imagery associated with The Cloud, WiFi has a very material and tangible provenance. From minerals and metals to its radiant energy, thereâ€™s a very blunt aspect of this entanglement of culture and infrastructure that is physical and extends into surrounding bodies.

These sculptures equipped with WiFi transceivers provide a reorganization of electromagnetic signals emitted by nearby routers and cell phones.
