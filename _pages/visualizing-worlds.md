A collection of wearable antennas made of copper and semi-precious stones modeled after the shapes and sizes of body parts, sections, appendages, ... They are meant to be worn around the part of the body from which they were modeled, creating an additional connection between the original template body and that of the wearer.

Like an [astrolabe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrolabe){:target="_blank"}, these antennas suggest a more embodied form of navigating a network. They are ontological machines for exploring the relationships between humans, nature, culture, objects and networks, and making these intra-actions a little more significantly felt.
